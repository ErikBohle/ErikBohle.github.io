# Bootstrap showcase + search API

This is a project where i focused on using bootstrap to create the page, 
and using libraries like awesomeplete to make a auto-suggesting searchbar.
It has modals that open and close through bootstrap.
A image carousel made with bootstrap.
And a product section where you can filter by data values using jQuery.
